# NOL-Project
This repository is for the nonlinear optimisation project. We will run experiments on two neural networks training on the MNIST fashion dataset. One of the networks will use AdaGrad while the other Nesterov acceleration. The goal is to perform a hyper-parameter optimisation on both and compare the results as well as the methods.
